# Streamlit Todo App

This is a simple Todo app built with Streamlit. I created this project as an introduction to Streamlit, exploring its capabilities for building interactive, data-driven applications. The app provides a straightforward interface for managing tasks, allowing users to add, update, and delete items on their todo list.
